### Web Design & Development

<info@lucacattide.dev> - [Website](https://lucacattide.dev)

## Getting Started

This is a [React](https://reactjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [react-boilerplate](https://github.com/lucacattide/react-boilerplate).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run start
# or
yarn start
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Using Docker

You may use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run both the `development` environment than the `production` one too.

#### Development

Build the `development` image and run the container:

```
docker-compose up -d --build
```

#### Production

Build the `production` image and run the container:

```
docker-compose -f docker-compose.prod.yml up -d --build
```

Remember to stop previous containers before switching from one to another, in order to avoid any issue:

```
docker-compose stop
```

### Using Kubernetes

You may use [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/) to orchestrate the `production` container.

#### Cluster Connection

Connect to your local cluster\*:

```
kubectl config use-context docker-desktop
```

#### Container image registry upload

Create a local Docker registry\*:

```
docker tag my-app localhost:5000/my-app
```

Push the image to the registry\*:

```
docker push localhost:5000/my-app
```

Deploy app\*:

```
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
```

Remove app:

```
kubectl delete service,deployment my-app
```

##### <sup>\*</sup> Otherwise use your Cloud service reference
